1.  In a large bowl, whisk eggs until light and fluffy (1-2 minutes).
2.  Gradually whisk in sugar until completely combined.
3.  Pour in milk, cream, vanilla and salt and whisk until blended.
4.  Transfer to a 4 qt ice cream maker and freeze. (You will need a 10 lb bag of cubed or crushed ice and a box of ice cream salt.)
5.  Ice cream may be served immediately, but it will be very soft. For harder ice cream, pour into an airtight container and freeze for approximately 8 hours.



NOTE:  1.  Using pasteurized eggs lowers the risk of salmonella contamination in recipes that use raw eggs. If you will be serving the ice cream to someone at high risk for foodborne illnesses, it's recommended you use a recipe that begins with a cooked custard base instead.
2.  Homemade ice cream is best eaten within 24-48 hours because it can become icy when stored longer. Also, homemade ice cream can freeze quite hard overnight. If it's too hard to scoop, set it out on the counter to soften for 15 minutes.
3.  For ultra creamy ice cream that will stay softer and last longer in the freezer without going icy, increase the number of eggs to 6 and use 6 cups cream and 3 cups of milk.
